# Accessible Form UI

A static, accessible form UI built with only HTML and CSS. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly, accessible form that includes fields for full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a password visibility toggle button, a completeness progress bar, and a checklist of form requirements.
